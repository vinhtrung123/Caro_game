# Caro Game
## Overview

This project implements a version of the Caro game in Python. The game is played on a grid, and the goal is to align five of your marks (either X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- **NumPy**: The script uses the NumPy library for numerical operations.
- Additional libraries may be required for the graphical interface (e.g., Pygame).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

2. **Install Required Libraries**: Install necessary Python libraries using pip.

   pip install numpy
   # If other libraries like Pygame are required, install them as well
   pip install pygame

3. **Run the Game**: Execute the `caro.py` script to start the game.

   python caro.py

## Features

- **Customizable Grid Size**: Change the number of rows and columns to adjust the grid size.
- **Graphical Interface**: The game uses a graphical interface to render the board and handle player interactions.
- **Player vs Player**: Play against another human player locally.

## How to Play

- The game is played on a grid, with players taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on the board.
- The objective is to align five consecutive marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.
- The first player to achieve this wins the game.

## Customization

- Modify the `ROWS` and `COLS` constants in the script to change the grid size.
- Adjust other graphical parameters (e.g., line width, circle radius) to customize the appearance.

## Future Improvements

- **AI Opponent**: Implement an AI to play against the computer.
- **Online Multiplayer**: Enable online gameplay with other players.
